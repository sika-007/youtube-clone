### Usage and Features

- Upon loading the application, users will be presented with a home page that displays a list of videos. 
- Users can browse videos by scrolling through the list, or they can use the search bar at the top of the page to search for videos and channels based on keywords.
- When a user clicks on a video, they will be taken to a video player page that displays the video and its details, such as the video title, description, time since upload, number of views and likes, and a list of related videos.
- When a user clicks on a channel's name or thumbnail, they will be taken to a channel page that displays some info about the channel as well as some videos from that channel. 
- The user, through the search bar has access to the entire catalog of YouTube videos. 

## Technologies Used
